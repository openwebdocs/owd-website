First and foremost, thank you for the outpouring of support and well-wishes for Open Web Docs following our launch post on Monday. We’re so excited to get to work with all of you to protect and maintain web platform documentation!

To help get things rolling with this new community, we’re hosting our first Open Web Docs community webinar on 17 February at 17:00 UTC ([see it in your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Open+Web+Docs+Community+Q%26A+Webinar&iso=20210217T1200&p1=43&ah=1)). We’ll be holding a live Q&A session with Open Web Docs team members, focusing on how we work, our goals, and how you can get involved.

We also want to hear from you - what would you like to see documented, and how would you like to see us make an impact on web platform documentation this year? You can submit your questions or ideas for the panel early via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpeqHVMMkj_hoRLioWgTqU57my3M1Fg-D17XIuA7CYqMF-vg/viewform) (note that responses are visible to the public).

[Subscribe to our calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y19vbGpyaTVyYmN1dGJmczkyb2ZwYTN1ajVzOEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) to receive meeting details directly. We really hope you can make it, but we’ll also record the session so you can watch it later.

We’re planning additional community calls throughout the year. Sign up for our [newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/19c29a396724/announcing-open-web-docs) or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenWebDocs) to get the latest updates from Florian and team!
