Open Web Docs is excited to announce that Jean-Yves Perrier has joined the team today as a full-time Sr. Technical Writer.

Previously a C++ software developer with a 10-year experience in multitasked applications and a long-time advocate of the open web, Jean-Yves has more than a decade of experience on web-related documentation, both as a volunteer and professionally.

In addition to his previous work on MDN and speaking at conferences, he has also been heavily involved with enabling a community of web advocates through the Mozilla Tech Speaker program, organising events, and creating curriculums. 

Jean-Yves is thrilled to help us build an Open Web documentation community!

Please join us in welcoming Jean-Yves Perrier!
