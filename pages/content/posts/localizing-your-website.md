A client of mine had recently asked me why it was so important to localize their web app.  They told me: “we just plug Google Translate in and it’s been fine. Why spend hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands on localization when you can do it for free with Google Translate?”

There is _so_ much to unpack about why that approach and mindset is _wrong_.

There are many different categories to consider when it comes to inclusivity of diverse audiences, whether it’s to accommodate sensory impairments, theming (dark/light mode), localization and more.  When designing your website/software, or perhaps updating it, one should consider every aspect of inclusion every step of the way to engage as wide of an audience as possible.  It is important that no portion is overlooked either, as then you risk your product appearing broken or incomplete.

Take alt. text attributes for images, for example.  Let’s say you have ten images, and you have properly and accurately described nine of the images using alt. text attributes (or marked them as decorative, but either way, you have followed accessibility standards for 90% of your images).  A visually impaired user that needs these attributes then goes to the page containing the image without an alt. text attribute, and suddenly, an entire element cannot be described to them.  Is it just decoration, or does it contain critical information that is essential to the rest of the page?  The screen reader doesn’t know (or maybe it could, but that’s a very big “maybe”), and the user doesn’t know.  To the visually impaired user, the web page would simply be broken.

The same can be said for localization.  Now, in this case, there is already very powerful machine translation software (such as Google Translate) that is able to translate entire documents, webpages, and even verbal conversations, and they’re only going to get more powerful.  However, machine translations can only do so much: the ones that are readily available to the common folk cannot comprehend context, including user interface options or special phrases (product names, etc.).  Additionally, machine translation is not able to capture the nuances and subtleties of languages.  Often times, this results in the wrong word selection, translations of phrases that shouldn’t be translated, inconsistency in word selection throughout paragraphs, and even completely wrong translations.  (I ran into this when attempting to automatically translate a Russian website to English, and the word selection was so bad, I had to ask my Russian translator to translate it for me instead.)

Going back to our previous example of missing alt. text attributes, let’s say that you translate a portion of your website, but don’t translate everything.  Perhaps you’ve translated the content but not the interface, or vice versa, or perhaps you’ve only translated part of the content.  Now the user is viewing content on your page in two different languages, but expects to only see one.  Machine translation software is now out of the question, as it is likely to end up picking up already-translated words and attempt to “translate” them again, or be unable to pick up what the original language is.  “What happened?” the user will think. “Is the website broken?  I can’t understand half of this…I guess I should search elsewhere.”

And that’s the real kicker.  Even if the user understands the original language, they would still think that something is wrong, which would provide a negative user experience and give your competitors an opportunity to gain your lost consumers.  However, if a user is requesting an alternate language, chances are high they can’t understand the original language in the first place!  By leaving your product partially translated (or realistically, untranslated at all), you are essentially telling the users that speak other languages: “we really don’t care about you.”

Another benefit of localizing your website is that it can improve search engine optimization (SEO).  Search engines are more likely to rank websites that are localized for different languages higher in search results, as they are seen as providing a better user experience for users who speak those languages, the same way that websites with accessibility considerations are ranked higher.  By localizing a website, you can increase your visibility in search results and have a greater chance at gaining more organic traffic.

Of course, it is also important to _maintain_ your localizations, rather than performing them once and calling it good.  As you update your website and add or modify content, it's important to ensure that the localized versions are kept up-to-date and accurately reflect the latest content.  This can help prevent users from coming across outdated or inaccurate information, which leads to a negative user experience and potentially drives users away from the website.

So, there you have it, Unnamed Client.  That is my answer to your question.
