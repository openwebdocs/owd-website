### Bloomberg Backs Open Web Docs to Support High-Quality Web Platform Documentation for All

High-quality documentation is essential for innovation and to facilitate the growth of web platform technologies. [Open Web Docs](https://openwebdocs.org) (OWD) plays a vital role in providing that documentation, especially through [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), a comprehensive resource covering CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Web APIs, and other web technologies. Our engineers use MDN extensively while performing front-end development for the Bloomberg Terminal – software for finance professionals that uses the Chromium web browser and JavaScript to render its user interface – and Bloomberg.com, among other products used across the financial industry around the world.

Bloomberg is proud to announce that it is now a Gold Sponsor of Open Web Docs. As part of this commitment, Alyssa Wright, a member of Bloomberg’s Open Source Program Office (OSPO) in the company’s Office of the CTO and Board Member of Open Source Collective, will also join the OWD Governing and Steering Committees. Bloomberg’s support will help ensure MDN remains a free resource for developers, suggest documentation priorities, and propose strategic partnerships.

“From my unique perspective as someone who was there at the start of Open Web Docs’ journey at Open Source Collective, I’ve always believed that excellent documentation is the fuel for open source innovation,” says Wright. “By supporting OWD, Bloomberg is investing in the long-term sustainability of the open web. We’re ensuring that developers have the tools they need to build, create, and maintain a healthy and accessible web for everyone.”

Software engineer Daniel Ehrenberg from Bloomberg’s JavaScript Infrastructure &amp; Terminal Experience team, a contributor to TC39 who also serves as the President of Ecma International, adds, “Sponsoring Open Web Docs is a natural part of Bloomberg’s commitment to the web platform. Maintaining the highest quality documentation requires paid, specialized technical writers, who OWD supports. This sponsorship will help ensure that MDN’s content remains comprehensive, updated, and freely available to all. MDN is a vital daily resource for Bloomberg engineers as they develop our products.”

Web technologies are constantly evolving and growing, and documentation needs to reflect that. Open Web Docs relies on donations to employ writers who update existing documentation, write new documentation, and improve documentation infrastructure in collaboration with other organizations. Bloomberg’s support will help fund OWD’s technical writing staff and the ongoing development of crucial documentation.

“Open Web Docs’ goal is to ensure developers and designers have the best information available for free so they can make decisions while building on the web platform. Sustainable funding is essential to our mission,” says Florian Scholz, Open Web Docs Co-Founder and Director. He continues, “Bloomberg has been a long-time champion of open web standards, and we’re thrilled to have them support our mission.” Read more about Bloomberg’s open source-first mission, the company’s commitments to supporting web standards, and ongoing contributions to CSS and JavaScript [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/values/tech-at-bloomberg/open-source/).
