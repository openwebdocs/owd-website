In 2024 Open Web Docs will enter its fourth year of operation, and our mission remains the same: to create and maintain the best possible web platform documentation, and make it available to everybody. We’re entirely funded by [sponsors](https://openwebdocs.org/sponsors/), and we’d like to thank everyone who has sponsored Open Web Docs this year.

Our two Platinum and founding sponsors, Google and Microsoft, have again sponsored us for 2024. Our Gold sponsor Igalia and our Silver sponsor Canva are also continuing their sponsorship. We’re grateful to all these organizations for their consistent support and their belief in the importance of our work.

This year we’ve also been sponsored by the [Sovereign Tech Fund](https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/), to continue our development of tools for the [browser compatibility data project](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data), particularly the Open Web Docs [mdn-bcd-collector project](https://github.com/openwebdocs/mdn-bcd-collector). The STF will also sponsor us again in 2024, and we’re really happy to see governments lending support to sustaining open source projects.

We’d also like to thank all the individuals who donated to us: we greatly appreciate your support and belief in our mission. All our donors are listed on our [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs).

We are a very low-overhead organization that converts all of this sponsoring into web documentation. Here’s a quick summary of the major projects we completed in 2023 thanks to you all:

* [Added reference docs for (almost) all web platform features supported by three browser engines](https://openwebdocs.org/content/posts/complete-interop-features/)
* [Rewrote, updated, and greatly expanded the Progressive Web App docs](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2023/08/09/pwa-documentation-mdn-web-docs-open-web-docs/)
* [Reworked, reorganized, updated all the Performance API docs](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/62)
* [Continued the overhaul of all CSS docs going module by module](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/147)
* [Retitled all 4000 pages in MDN’s Web/API reference documentation](https://openwebdocs.org/content/posts/web-api-page-titles/)
* [Fixed compatibility data going back to at least 2020](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/85)
* [Updated all example code that used XMLHttpRequest to use fetch() instead](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/156)
* [Attended the W3C “Secure the Web Forward” workshop to work out a plan for better web security documentation](https://openwebdocs.org/content/posts/secure-the-web-forward/)
* [Traveled to TPAC Sevilla to talk about web platform documentation](https://openwebdocs.org/content/posts/tpac-sevilla/)
* [Joined the W3C WebDX community group](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/)
* [Helped grouping web platform features](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/169)
* [Started implementing a pipeline to automatically update compatibility data when a new browser version is released](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/168)

Additionally, we’ve continued the day-to-day maintenance of the [mdn/content](https://github.com/mdn/content) and the [mdn/browser-compat-data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) repositories, fixing issues and reviewing PRs. Thanks to the awesome people who volunteer their time to help improve MDN: working with you is one of the highlights of this project.

Thank you, also, to the Mozilla MDN team for being great partners as we collaborate on maintaining MDN.

We have lots of plans for 2024, which we’ll share with you in the new year!
