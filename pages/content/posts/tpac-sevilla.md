Last week I traveled to Seville, Spain to attend the [W3C TPAC 2023 conference](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/TPAC/).

Every year, the W3C <dfn id="tpac"><abbr title="Technical Plenary and Advisory Committee">TPAC</abbr></dfn> conference invites W3C members and boards, W3C Working and Interest Groups, as well as Invited Experts and others to meet and discuss work on web standards and web technologies. This time it was a hybrid event - participation was possible in-person and remotely.

It was my first in-person TPAC event and enjoyed meeting a lot of folks that I only interacted with online so far. It was a great feeling when people recognized me or Open Web Docs and had nice things to say.
I received kudos for Open Web Docs' setup as a non-profit Open Collective and I was also told that folks enjoy reading about the projects we achieved on MDN Web Docs. Some even watch our [GitHub project repository](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project) to hear all about our new projects immediately (cheers, Thomas Steiner!).

If you attend an in-person event these days, it really is about the people. So, let me give a shout out to "my" people at TPAC: I connected with a few OWD governing board members, including Rachel Andrew (Google), Daniel Appelquist (Synk), Patrick Brosset (Microsoft), Dominique Hazael-Massieux (W3C), and Robert Nyman (Google). I also met members of OWD's steering committee, including Ruth John (Mozilla), Brian Kardell (Igalia), Lola Odelola, Brian Smith (Mozilla), and Michael[tm] Smith (W3C).
Since our founding, we only had a single OWD meetup ([in London, earlier this year](https://openwebdocs.org/content/posts/london-meetup/)) and so it was lovely to reconnect and talk about web platform documentation once again.

## Technical writing breakout session

To me, the most interesting day was Wednesday. Wednesday was the day for breakout sessions in an unconference style. In collaboration with Rachel and Patrick, I chaired a breakout session: "Getting your feature adopted: learn to work with technical writers" in which we invited the participants to discuss about how to improve technical writing and documenting web technologies. We touched on topics like finding relevant Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and presented how typically documentation gets written and maintained. [Shawn Lawton Henry](https://www.w3.org/People/Shawn/) (W3C WAI) also let us know there is currently help needed for the [Understanding WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/) docs. Find the [full minutes of our session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pNHLKwPs0nZ5KCY_cV05unjnL1iHKlb7CW2CQwbGGrs/edit).

One thing to say about chairing and attending TPAC sessions is that I really enjoyed how scribing was taken seriously and how it is possible to be added to the speaker queue by typing "q+" in the IRC channels. You know, as an introvert it can be quite stressful to figure out the right moment to speak up in a room full of (very damn smart) people. Thanks to this, I q+'ed myself, was acknowledged by the chair and could bring up my question or comment. If you are interested in more mechanics of this, I found a blog post on the bocoup blog that has more information: [How to scribe at TPAC](https://bocoup.com/blog/how-to-scribe-at-tpac).

## More sessions

I recently joined the [WebDX W3C community group](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/) and attended breakout sessions that were related to WebDX:

- Interop project, chaired by James Graham (Mozilla). [Minutes](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/13-interop-minutes.html).
- Beyond Interop, chaired by Kadir Topal (Google). [Minutes](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/13-beyond-interop-minutes.html).
- WebDX research and spec development, chaired by François Daoust (W3C). [Minutes](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/13-webdx-minutes.html).
- Secure the Web Forward, chaired by Daniel Appelquist (Synk). (need to find the minutes link)

Open Web Docs is going to collaborate a lot more the WebDX group going forward. I strongly believe documentation is a major aspect of Developer Experience and the research and work this community group is doing is very relevant to our mission. I met with Daniel Beck and Kadir Topal (Google) to discuss the next steps for the OWD project ["Grouping web features"](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/169). Daniel also made a video about it, go [watch it](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/TPAC/demos/web-features.html).

The "Secure the Web Forward" session was also good preparation the virtual workshop happening soon on September 26-28. See the [agenda](https://www.w3.org/2023/03/secure-the-web-forward/agenda.html). We are looking forward to discuss web security docs and security education with security experts. While talking to Arnaud Le Hors (IBM) I realized that we should probably figure out what would go into an "MDN guide to secure your website / web app". I'm very much looking forward to this workshop and I'm curious to see how the format will play out. Expect a blog post soon about it soon!

## Wrap up

And that's it! I really enjoyed the face-to-face conversations, even if it was just briefly near the pool with Bert Bos, Brian Kardell, Ali Spivak, Oliver Dunk and others which I'm probably forgetting right now (sorry!). Also, happy birthday to Diego González with whom we had a great dinner at a Tapas restaurant.

Hoping to see you all at the next TPAC! Let's try to bring the whole OWD team who have had some severe FOMO this year!
