We're launching a new W3C Community Group, the [Documentation CG](https://www.w3.org/community/docs-cg/) (Docs CG). This group is an open community with the mission to ensure web developers and designers worldwide have the best information available so they can build things on the web platform.

The group is open to anyone to join. If you would like to join, please visit the [group's homepage](https://www.w3.org/community/docs-cg/join). To follow along with the group's activities, you can watch the [repository](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webdocs) on GitHub where we are going to post meeting minutes and where we can have discussions in issues.

The group is meant for technical writers, documentation practitioners, specification authors, subject matter experts, and web developers to collaborate. While we at Open Web Docs have the most experience with MDN Web Docs, we also want to explicitly invite other web platform doc sites and authors to this group to share best practices and create a common understanding of how to document web platform technologies.

We believe that technical writing is essential for web platform technologies to be adopted and understood globally. We further believe it is necessary to have more conversations between:

- specification authors who create web technologies,
- technical writers who create web docs, and
- web developers and designers who need to understand and want to use web technologies.

By offering a place to bring all these perspectives together, the Docs CG aspires to help authoring better web platform documentation for all.

A W3C Community Group for documentation is suitable for this work as it also allows us to coordinate our efforts in collaboration with other (horizontal) W3C groups, such as [WebDX](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/), [Security](https://www.w3.org/mission/security/), [Privacy](https://www.w3.org/mission/privacy/), [Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/mission/accessibility/), [Internationalization](https://www.w3.org/mission/internationalization/), [Sustainability](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/), and more.

The W3C Docs CG will be chaired by Lola Odelola ([lolaslab.co](https://lolaslab.co)) and Florian Scholz (Open Web Docs). We would love to welcome you on our [slack channel](https://w3ccommunity.slack.com/archives/C08KNG3GFEF) ([invite](https://www.w3.org/slack-w3ccommunity-invite)) or in the upcoming [Docs CG calls](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/docs-cg/calendar/)!
