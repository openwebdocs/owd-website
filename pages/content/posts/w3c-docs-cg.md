We're launching a new W3C Community Group, the [Documentation CG](https://www.w3.org/community/docs-cg/) (Docs CG). This group is an open community with the mission to ensure web developers and designers worldwide have the best information available so they can build things on the web platform.

The Docs CG is open to everyone. If you would like to join, please visit the [Docs CG homepage](https://www.w3.org/community/docs-cg/join). To follow the group's activities, subscribe to the [Docs CG repository](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webdocs) on GitHub, where meeting minutes will be posted and asynchronous discussions will take place.

The goal of the group is to provide an open forum for technical writers, documentation practitioners, specification authors, subject matter experts, and web developers to collaborate. While we at Open Web Docs have a lot of experience with MDN Web Docs, we also want to explicitly invite other web platform documentation authors and publishing sites to join and share best practices and create a common understanding of how best to document web platform technologies.

We believe that technical writing is essential for web platform technologies to be adopted and understood globally. We further believe it is necessary to have more conversations between:

- Specification authors: the designers of web technologies,
- Browser implementers: the implementers of the specifications,
- Technical writers: the educators who document the specifications, and
- Web developers and designers: the creators who build and design, relying on high-quality implementation and documentation of the specifications.

By offering an active community that brings all of these perspectives together, the Docs CG aspires to facilitate excellent documentation of every web platform feature for every creator designing and building on the web platform.

By existing within the W3C Community Groups program, the Docs CG will greatly benefit from being part of a wider community which will allow us to coordinate efforts in collaboration with other (horizontal) W3C groups, such as [WebDX](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/), [Security](https://www.w3.org/mission/security/), [Privacy](https://www.w3.org/mission/privacy/), [Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/mission/accessibility/), [Internationalization](https://www.w3.org/mission/internationalization/), [Sustainability](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/), and others.

The W3C Docs CG will be chaired by Lola Odelola ([lolaslab.co](https://lolaslab.co)) and Florian Scholz (Open Web Docs). We'd love to welcome you to our [Slack channel](https://w3ccommunity.slack.com/archives/C08KNG3GFEF) ([invite](https://www.w3.org/slack-w3ccommunity-invite)) and to our upcoming [Docs CG calls](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/docs-cg/calendar/).
