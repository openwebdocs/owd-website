        <p class="mid-paragraph">
          Will Bamberg is a perfectionist and professional pedant who has been
          writing about the web for a long time, mostly on MDN. He enjoys
          learning about new aspects of the web platform and then turning that
          knowledge into accessible documentation. He believes that writing good
          documentation depends on understanding what it's like for someone who
          is learning something new or looking for the answer to their question.
