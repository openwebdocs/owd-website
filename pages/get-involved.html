  <h1>Get Involved</h1>
  <p>
    If you're interested in helping to ensure that the Web has high-quality
    accessible documentation, available to everyone, here are some of the ways
    you can help us out.
  </p>

  <h2>Contribute to MDN Web Docs</h2>

  <p>
    We think <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN Web Docs</a> is the
    best web docs site out there, and we spend most of our time maintaining and
    extending it, mostly through contributions to the
    <a href="https://github.com/mdn/content">mdn/content</a> repo.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you'd like to help out with this work, a great place to start is by
    fixing issues in mdn/content. The
    <a href="https://github.com/mdn/content">mdn/content README</a> has
    instructions for contributing to the repo.
  </p>

  <p>
    Have a look at the
    <a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/issues">issue backlog</a>. Issues
    include typos, errors, things that are not clear, as well as requests for
    new documentation. If you're getting started, have a look at the issues
    labeled
    <a
      href="https://github.com/mdn/content/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22"
      >good first issue</a
    >, but you don't have to restrict yourself to this list. If you want to take
    an issue, ask us to assign it to you. Please feel free to ask for help —
    we're always happy to provide guidance for contributors.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you'd like to propose a bigger change, we track potential Open Web Docs
    projects as issues in the
    <a href="https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues"
      >openwebdocs/project</a
    >
    repository. Please
    <a
      href="https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/new?assignees=&labels=not+ready&template=owd-project.yml"
      >file an issue on GitHub</a
    >
    and we'll consider it in our project planning. If you'd like to help out
    with a proposal we have already listed, comment on the issue. We'd love to
    talk to you about it.
  </p>

  <h2>Attend an event</h2>
